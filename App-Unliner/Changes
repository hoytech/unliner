  * Don't clean-up temp directory when UNLINER_DEBUG is specified.
    This is so you can go inspect any generated scripts after.
  * The tests incorrectly hard-coded the name of the perl binary
    which was caused tests to fail on some systems (thanks CPAN
    testers). $^X fix suggested by Andreas J. KÃ¶nig.
  * Allow unliner programs to be read from standard input if the
    unliner script name is omitted or is "-".
